Module for manipulating SMPTE timecode. Supports 60, 59.94, 50, 30, 29.97, 25, 24, 23.98 frame rates in drop and non-drop where applicable, and milliseconds. It also supports
operator overloading for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

iter_return sets the format that iterations return, the options are "tc" for a timecode string,
"frames" for a int total frames, and "tc_tuple" for a tuple of ints in the following format,
(hours, minutes, seconds, frames).

Notes: *There is a 24 hour SMPTE Timecode limit, so if your time exceeds that limit, it will roll over.
       *2 PyTimeCode objects of the same frame rate is the only supported way to combine PyTimeCode objects, 
            for example adding them together.
